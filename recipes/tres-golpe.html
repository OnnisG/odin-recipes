    <p><strong>Tres Golpes</strong> is a traditional <strong>Dominican</strong>  breakfast that consists of three key components:
    <strong> mangu, salami, and fried eggs.</strong>  The base of the dish is mangu, which is made from boiled and mashed green plantains. 
     This creamy, savory mash is often seasoned with a bit of salt and can be served with a drizzle of olive oil or vinegar
     for added flavor. Accompanying the mangu are slices of salami, which are typically pan-fried until crispy,
     providing a rich and hearty contrast to the plantains. The dish is completed with fried eggs, cooked sunny-side up or
     to personal preference, adding protein and richness. </p>

    <p>Tres Golpes <em> its not just a meal</em> ; it embodies the essence of <strong>Dominican culinary culture</strong> , bringing together simple, 
     accessible ingredients that are deeply satisfying. It is often enjoyed with a side of pickled red onions or avocado,
     enhancing its flavors and textures. Commonly served in households across the Dominican Republic,
     this breakfast reflects the country's agricultural heritage and the importance of communal meals.
