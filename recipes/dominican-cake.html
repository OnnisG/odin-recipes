        <h3>Steps</h3>
         
        <p><strong>Before starting</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 °F [175 °C], or 325 ºF [163 ºC] for convection ovens (see notes).</li>
            <li>Mix the flour and baking powder and sift together. Divide into thirds and set aside.</li>
            <li>Grease the baking pans, and lightly dust with flour. Set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        


        <ol>
            <li>Beating butter</li>	
        </ol>
                <p>Using the paddle attachment of your mixer, 
                beat together butter and sugar at medium speed 
                until the butter is light and fluffy and has a 
                very light yellow color (about 4 mins).</p>


        <ol start="2">
            <li>Adding eggs</li>
        </ol>

                <p>Add the eggs a third at a time, and continue beating
                until each third is well incorporated into the mixture 
                (about 2 mins) before adding the next third.Once eggs are added,
                with the mixer still running at mid-speed, add in vanilla and 
                lime zest.</p>

    
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Adding juice + flour</li>
        </ol> 

                <p>Increase speed to mid-high, and pour in a third of the juice, 
                when it is well combined (about two mins) add a third of the flour
                and mix for another 2 mins. Pour in another third of the juice and mix 
                for another 2 mins or until it is very well combined.
                Follow by adding another third of the flour, 
                and mix for another 2 mins or until it is very well combined.
                Pour in the last third of the juice and mix for another 2 mins
                or until it is very well combined. Follow by adding the last third of the flour, 
                and mix for another 2 mins or until it is very well combined.</p>

        <ol start="4">       
            <li>Filling the pans</li>
        </ol> 

                <p>As soon as you've stopped mixing the last batch of flour turn off the mixer, 
                you should have obtained a fluffy batter with a smooth and even consistency. 
                If necessary, scrape the sides and run for another minute to combine any unmixed batter
                that was stuck to the sides. Pour in half the batter in each baking pan,
                making sure not to disturb the butter/flour cover.</p>

        <ol start="5"> 
            <li>Baking</li>
        </ol> 
                <p>Bake 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean
                (don't open the oven until after at least 30 mins). 
                Cool to room temperature before removing from the pan.
